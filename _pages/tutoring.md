Outside of my academic research at the University of Cambridge, I offer tutoring for A-Level/GCSE Maths and Physics, as well as mentoring for University Admissions. These can take place online, or in-person. I am based in the UK, splitting my time between Cambridge and London. I have hundreds of hours of teaching experience, and an enhanced DBS certificate that I am happy to provide upon request.
<p style="text-align: left;"> <i> My rates start at £40ph.

<p style="font-family: 'Figtree', sans-serif; font-size: 1.8rem;"> About Me:</p>
At some point in my academic journey, I realized one cannot be a good physicist without also being a great teacher. Richard Feynman said: *"If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it”* -- and he was absolutely right! 

I like to stay immersed in physics. To me, problem-solving is both a career, and a pastime. This is why I find teaching so important, and why I go to great lengths to pass on my enthusiasm. My teaching style is problem-focused: I explain the key concepts by way of examples. A typical lesson consists of going through carefully chosen questions, with the student receiving plenty of insight and feedback along the way.

Unlike some tutors, I never spoon-feed. I will guide you through the syllabus, help when you get stuck, but the work is ultimately yours to put in — and by the end, the benefits will be yours to reap.

        <i> ''My daughter has found Jed to be a great help. She felt fully up to speed with A-level Maths during her Lower Sixth year, but during the Upper Sixth, the quicker pace of new concepts meant that sometimes her understanding slipped. Having done well in her end of Lower Sixth, she had gaps in her knowledge appearing. What has worked really well is bringing a variety of maths problems to go through. She finds Jed excellent at explaining solutions in a number of different ways. He genuinely seems to care that his students' understanding improves rather than just taking payment for his time'' </i> - Joanna F.

        <i> ''Two qualities in particular set Jed apart. First, his manner. He has the ability to present complex topics in a simple and down-to-earth manner. If the student doesn't understand or grasp the material in the first pass, he approaches it from another angle. Second, he is caring. My children believe that he cares about their ability to learn and master material, and this in turn helps them them to focus and want to learn.'' </i> - Robin L.
