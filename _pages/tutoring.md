I offer tutoring for A-Level Mathematics and Physics, as well as preparation for the Oxford PAT & TSA entrance exams. These can take place online, or in-person. I am based in the UK, currently splitting my time between Cambridge and London. I have an enhanced DBS certificate for working with children, which I am happy to provide upon request.

I teach a wide variety of groups, ranging from GCSE students to undergraduates. I aim to foster the skills and intuition which make a great scientist -- so that my students develop confidence in their subject and learn to appreciate the beauty of Natural Sciences.

About Me:
</div>
At some point in my academic journey, I realized one cannot be a good physicist without also being a great teacher. Richard Feynman said: *"If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it”* -- and he was absolutely right! 

I like to stay immersed in physics: to me, problem-solving is both a career, and a pastime. This is why I find teaching so important, and why I’ll go to great lengths to pass on my enthusiasm. My teaching style is problem-focused. In our lessons, I will explain the key concepts by way of examples. We will work through questions, with me giving plenty of insight and feedback along the way.

Unlike some tutors, I never spoon-feed: I will guide you through the syllabus, help when you get stuck, but the work is ultimately yours to put in — and by the end, the benefits will be yours to reap.
