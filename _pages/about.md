I am a 2nd year PhD Student in the [Cavendish Laboratory Quantum Information Group](https://www.qi.phy.cam.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge, working in collaboration with Dr Sergii Strelchuk at DAMPT. My supervisor is Professor Crispin Barnes. 

My main interests include Quantum Benchmarking and Group-Theoretic methods in Quantum Computing. In particular, I am currently researching lightweight algorithms for calculating gate fidelities on near-term quantum devices. 

I was born in Krakow, and grew up in the UK. Prior to my PhD I attended Brasenose College, University of Oxford. My Bachelor’s was in Physics & Philosophy, and my Master’s in Mathematical & Theoretical Physics. Aside from my research, I teach Physics to 1st year Natural Science students at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. 

[I also tutor Maths & Physics!](/tutoring/)
