I am a 2nd year PhD Student at St John's College, Cambridge, working at the [Cavendish Laboratory Quantum Information Group](https://www.qi.phy.cam.ac.uk) in collaboration with Dr Sergii Strelchuk at DAMTP. My supervisor is Professor Crispin Barnes.

My main interests include Quantum Benchmarking and Group-Theoretic methods in Quantum Computing. In particular, I am currently researching lightweight algorithms for calculating gate fidelities on near-term quantum devices. 

I was born in Krakow, and have lived in the UK since 2011. Prior to my PhD I attended Brasenose College, Oxford, where I obtained a BA in Physics & Philosophy followed by a Masterâ€™s in Mathematical & Theoretical Physics.

Aside from my research, I teach the Physics IA course at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and also [offer private tutoring.](/tutoring)
