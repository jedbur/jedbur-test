I am a 3rd year PhD Student at St John's College, Cambridge, working at the [Cavendish Laboratory Quantum Information Group](https://www.qi.phy.cam.ac.uk). I am co-supervised by [Dr Sergii Strelchuk](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/ss870) (at DAMPT/Oxford) and [Professor Crispin Barnes](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/barnesc).

My main interests include quantum algorithms and group-theoretic methods in quantum computing. In particular, I am interested in lightweight benchmarking protocols for restricted computational models (such as [Matchgate Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07974)), as well as the computational models themselves (such as Permutational Quantum Computing, or Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distributions).

I was born in Krakow, and have lived in the UK since 2011. Prior to my PhD I attended Brasenose College, Oxford, where I obtained a BA in Physics & Philosophy followed by a Master’s in Mathematical & Theoretical Physics.

Aside from my research I supervise the Physics IA course at Emmanuel College, as well as the Mathematics Part II course in Quantum Information and Computation. I also [offer private tutoring.](/tutoring)
