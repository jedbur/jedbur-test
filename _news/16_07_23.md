Happy to share that I've recently joined Quantinuum Cambridge as a Summer Intern, working with the Quantum Chemistry team on theory, under the supervision of Dr Nathan Fitzpatrick. 

I will go back to doing my PhD in mid October. In the meantime, I'm looking forward to learning about Quantum Computational Chemistry, and making my own contributions to the team!
